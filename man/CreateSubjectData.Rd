\title{Create a list of subject-specific data}
\usage{
CreateSubjectData(id, y, x, z, Weights, SampProb, cutpoints, w.function)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{sum(n_i) vector of subject ids}

\item{y}{response vector}

\item{x}{sum(n_i) by p design matrix for fixed effects}

\item{z}{sum(n_i) by 2 design matric for random effects (intercept and slope)}

\item{Weights}{Subject specific sampling weights.  A vector of length sum(n_i).  Not used unless using weighted Likelihood}

\item{SampProb}{A matrix with the first dimension equal to sum(n_i).   Sampling probabilities from within each region [bivariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 2 c(central region, outlying region); univariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 3 with sampling probabilities for each region]. Each subject should have n_i rows of the same values.}

\item{cutpoints}{A matrix with the first dimension equal to sum(n_i).  These cutpoints define the sampling regions [bivariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 4 c(xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh); univariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 2 c(k1,k2) to define the sampling regions, i.e., low, middle, high].  Each subject should have n_i rows of the same values.}

\item{w.function}{sum(n_i) vector with possible values that include "mean" "intercept" "slope" and "bivariate."  There should be one unique value per subject}
