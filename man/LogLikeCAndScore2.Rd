\arguments{
\item{params}{parameter vector c(beta, log(sigma0), log(sigma1), rho, sigmae)}

\item{y}{response vector}

\item{x}{sum(n_i) by p design matrix for fixed effects}

\item{z}{sum(n_i) by 2 design matric for random effects (intercept and slope)}

\item{id}{sum(n_i) vector of subject ids}

\item{w.function}{sum(n_i) vector with possible values that include "mean" (mean of response series), "intercept" (intercept of the regression of Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the random effects (solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[1,]), "intercept1"  (intercept of the regression of Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the random effects (solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[1,]). "intercept2" (second intercept of the regression of the Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the bivariate random effects (b10,b11,b20,b21) solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[3,]), "slope" (slope of the regression of Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the random effects (solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[2,]), "slope1" (slope of the regression of Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the random effects (solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[2,]), "slope2" (second slope of the regression of the Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the bivariate random effects (b10,b11,b20,b21) solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[4,]) "bivariate" (intercept and slope of the regression of Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the random effects (solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[c(1,2),]) "mvints" (first and second intercepts of the bivariate regression of the Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the bivariate random effects (b10,b11,b20,b21) solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[c(1,3),]) "mvslps" (first and second slopes of the bivariate regression of the Yi ~ zi where zi is the design matrix for the bivariate random effects (b10,b11,b20,b21) solve(t.zi %*% zi) %*% t.zi)[c(1,3),]).  There should be one unique value per subject}

\item{cutpoints}{A matrix with the first dimension equal to sum(n_i).  These cutpoints define the sampling regions [bivariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 4 c(xlow, xhigh, ylow, yhigh); univariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 2 c(k1,k2) to define the sampling regions, i.e., low, middle, high].  Each subject should have n_i rows of the same values.}

\item{SampProb}{A matrix with the first dimension equal to sum(n_i).   Sampling probabilities from within each region [bivariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 2 c(central region, outlying region); univariate Q_i: each row is a vector of length 3 with sampling probabilities for each region]. Each subject should have n_i rows of the same values.}

\item{Weights}{Subject specific sampling weights.  A vector of length sum(n_i).  Not used unless using weighted Likelihood}

\item{ProfileCol}{the column number(s) for which we want fixed at the value of param.  Maimizing the log likelihood for all other parameters
while fixing these columns at the values of params[ProfileCol]}

\item{Keep.liC}{If TRUE outputs subject specific conditional log lileihoods to be used for the imputation procedure described in the AOAS paper keep z sum(n_i) by 2 design matric for random effects (intercept and slope)}
}
\value{
The conditional log likelihood with a "gradient" attribute (if Keep.liC=FALSE) and subject specific contributions to the conditional likelihood if Keep.liC=TRUE).
