Description: When outcome covariates are available one can perform biased
  sampling to maximize information returned, or outcome dependent sampling
  (ODS). This is especially helpful
  to minimize exposure or an expensive test. The statistical analysis
  requires correction and this package has routines to assist in this
  process via multiple methods. See 'Two-Phase, Generalized Case-Control
  Designs for the Study of Quantitative Longitudinal Outcomes.' Schildcrout,
