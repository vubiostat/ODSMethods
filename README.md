# ODSMethods

This package is a draft at present to bring together a wide variety of outcome dependent sampling (ODS) methods led by professors at Vanderbilt University.

## Healthy Package Development

* All test cases PASS before every push to main repository.
* CRAN Check should have 0 ERRORs and 0 WARNINGS before every push to the main repository. This prevents a huge amount of work later.
* No files added to repository unless they need to be. This is intended to be a working package _not a pile._
* Work incrementally. Change one or add one small thing at a time. 
* User interface is super important at this stage, think carefully about a user who knows little about these tools and will just take data and play. Make discovery easy. Follow the principal of least surprise.
* Never use a "." dot in a function or variable name. This is a very strong recommendation from the core R team as it can cause problems with S3 dispatch--which this package will rely on.
* Reference code goes into a "helper" file in tests. This is code that has been validated via a published study. It should _**not**_ be edited in any way.
* Routines in the "R" directory is the working published and polished code.
* A routine in the "R" directory needs a tedious amount of tests that consider not only user interface, but the results and compares them with reference code.
* Proper author reference/license in each code file, and the author needs to be part of the DESCRIPTION.
* It should be dependency adverse. An imports for say tidyverse creates a huge dependency liability. Suggests for a package is okay, but to be avoided and should include required checks that a package is loaded if needed.

## Needs

* Need a slide show of goals / design / result.
* [Deep] Finish acml to every deep corner and usage.
  * coef() should return transformed coefficients (test should be raw). Maybe coef(model, raw=TRUE)?
  * Add names to R estimates including the 4 additional parameters
  * Add vcov that returns both levels in the manner of lme4
  * Add computation of rank/df for variables
  * Add 'fitted.values' to acml
  * Add 'residuals' to acml (and S3 routine)
  * Add format / summary to acml, coefficients, confidence intervals, p-values.
  * Add plot to acml
  * Add user interface tests to acml
  * Add sample method to odsdesign
  NOTE: In general use lm() and lmer() object output and functions as guide.  
* [Refine] acml. 
  * Replace with ACML.LME (not the validated test version!)
  * Add the analytical Hessian (Lucy)
  * Optimize for speed.
* [Document]
  * Add reference data sets preferably from papers.
  * Add vignette on usage. (start with acml)
* [Expand] Fill in wide and deep for all routines identified in specification.
* [Get Credit] Write paper for Journal of Statistical Software


### TO DO LIST

#### Lucy

* Read a few _more_ sections of "Writing R Extensions"
  ~~Lucy read 3 sections and will continue~~
* Create 3 slides (include title and credits). 1 slide with goals/example/?
* Get SMLE running, in the linear model settings
* Add format / summary to acml, "print.acml function"

#### Shawn

* Investigate convergence issues with BLAS differences. specifically vcov is way off on mac.
  Apple M1 it fails on.

* Add raw=TRUE to coef, vcov

it probably makes sense to add all of them, even if you have a stop message that says "this method isn't implemented yet" -- Cole Beck 3/12/25

## Example Updated Calls to Other Methods

To include BLUP, 

ods(..., BLUP="bivariate") (or "slope", or "intercept") is all that would be required. Default BLUP=NULL. 

This also requires the updated Chiara code integrated.

Thinking about SIEVE

* Y is fine, comes from _method_(formula)
* X is fine, comes from _method_(formula)
* Z would come from _design_(formula) call

What is Delta? Survival event, check survival packages how this is specified.

Bspline_Z should come from the formula of the _method_.
scale, maxiter, tol,  are control values.

His model value, "linear", "logistic" or "coxph". 

_method_ would be SMLE in this case.
